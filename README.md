On a Mac, download and open the "email-template.emltpl" file. A new Outlook email should appear, and you can replace the dummy text with whatever message.

The "click here" button should already be hyperlinked to the webpage, but please double check before sending. 

## Webpage
The landing page's content can be found and edited in the "index.html" and "main.css" files. The goals page's content is in the "goal.css" and "goals.html" files. To edit the text for each goal, edit the "holiday-content.js" file. In that file, there will be a JavaScript object with each of the goals and their content as key-value pairs. The goals are listed in numerical order (from least to greatest).# holiday-cards
